## üîç Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
The challenge provides a single file: `postcard.jpg`

This is a postcard image from Tunisia that appears to be a normal tourist postcard at first glance.

### Step 2: Metadata Examination
The first clue is in the challenge description: "Check the metadata carefully - every field might hold a clue"

Using **ExifTool** to examine the metadata:
```bash
exiftool postcard.jpg
```

**Key Metadata Fields Found:**
- **Artist**: "The Zodiac"
- **Copyright**: "Gorjeni Investigation Unit"
- **UserComment**: "Tr4cK_Th3_Tr41l" ‚≠ê **This is the password!**
- **XPComment**: "Tr4cK_Th3_Tr41l"
- **GPS Coordinates**: 36.8065¬∞N, 10.1815¬∞E (Tunis, Tunisia)
- **DateTime**: 2025:01:15 14:30:00

### Step 3: Steganography Extraction
The password "Tr4cK_Th3_Tr41l" is used with **Steghide** to extract hidden content:

```bash
steghide extract -sf postcard.jpg -p "Tr4cK_Th3_Tr41l"
```

This extracts a hidden file: `Zodiac.jpg`

### Step 4: Analyzing the Hidden Image
The extracted image `Zodiac.jpg` contains:
- A mysterious figure (The Zodiac)
- The flag: `SecurinetsENIT{M3t4D4TA_C4n_R3v34L_Th3_D4rkN355}`

### Step 5: Bonus Discovery
For the next challenge, players should examine the metadata of the extracted `Zodiac.jpg`:

```bash
exiftool Zodiac_small.jpg
```

**Hidden Clue Found:**
- **UserComment**: "https://pastebin.com/6KRtTQVP"
- **XPComment**: "https://pastebin.com/6KRtTQVP"

This pastebin link contains the password for the next challenge's zip file: `P4cK3t_N1nj4`
