# Khlos l Supplier

Recently, one of the company’s main suppliers was hacked.
Because of your close communication flow (mails, calls) with them, your company may now be a target.

You’ve been handed a dump of John Meller’s mailbox: the supervisor responsible for communications with the supplier.

Your job: analyze his emails and check if anything suspicious has been sent recently.

Fingers crossed it’s nothing bad.
