SAFE SIMULATION: Genocoide-as-a-Service (non-destructive)
------------------------------------------------------------------
This script SIMULATES killing processes and replacing files for a CTF forensics
challenge. It does NOT terminate any processes or permanently delete user files.

Behavior summary (safe):
 - Detects candidate processes (non-protected), logs intended kills, and writes a marker file per "killed" process in the quarantine folder.
 - Moves files from the challenge path to a recoverable quarantine folder.
 - Recreates placeholder files at the original locations named "theyre just collateral damage" (so players see content replaced).
 - If an "images" subfolder exists (or is created), writes a few harmless 1x1 PNG placeholder files named "fake-dead-babies_#.png".
 - Writes a forged blame log "We are not the victims.log" that blames AV-like processes (forensics artifact).
 - All real system-impacting operations are intentionally omitted; this is safe for a CTF VM.

WARNING: Run only in an isolated VM or test folder. Do NOT run on production systems.
