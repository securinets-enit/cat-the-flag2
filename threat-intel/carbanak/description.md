### Solution 

The first question could be answered quickly from `MITRE` framework, arriving at the second one, the player is asked about the first ever report by Kaspersky Lab. Seeing this, the players should directly consider the first report as their first source. One might think that maybe a first report could be unsure or not very accurate or whatsoever. Me personally, I consider it a good instinct to cross reference, but I don't think it's possible for a research team that big to post inaccurate technical report. 

Going through the report, the players shouldn't have any trouble finding the necessary stuff. Going through CHatGPT will indeed prove wrong, as usual.
