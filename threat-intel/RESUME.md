# README

Although I'm not a blue teamer or trying to land a blue teaming job, but I enjoy reading and consuming blue teaming content as it highly benefits my red teaming thinking process and my overall skills in networking.

I've noticed that blue teaming is considered to be digital forensics in CTFs, so I decided to introduce this field in our CTF.

For this challenge, It is an easy one, nothing very technical to analyse or to extract, you just need to dig and find the right resources.

In most of the challenges, you just need the right report/blog. I tried my best to find stories that have missmatching references so the players don't get confused.

### What players did wrong 

Many new players quickly resorted to ChatGPT, which can answer most of the questions, until it came to references or techniques, tactics and procedures, dates about the visibility of the APTs, highly technical details (to be extracted from real reports) like file hashes and file names, and of course it blinded the players from actually reading the questions because tickets were opened just to find out that the player isn't answering the question that was proposed.
