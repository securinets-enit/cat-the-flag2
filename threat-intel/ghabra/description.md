CrowdStrike has just pushed its infamous faulty update, crippling critical infrastructure worldwide; airports grounded, hospitals offline, BSODs everywhere.

Tunisia, however, seems “miraculously” untouched: can't affoard the crowdstrike solutions, nor the windows license..

You arrive at your corporate job expecting a normal day, but your phone rings:

HQ: “We’ve just seen a new Mandiant report: Something tied to APT41 and exploiting this chaos. You’re the analyst on duty. You don’t leave until we know whether our organization is compromised. Grab coffee: it’s going to be a long night.”

Your task: investigate artifacts provided by HQ, extract IOCs, map techniques to MITRE ATT&CK, and confirm whether APT41 is inside your network. This isn't a normal day as you expected.
