# Na7i lmask ya Spain fe9na bik

Your country was a target of a cyber espionnage compaign lead by a nation-state threat actor from 2007 until 2014. 

No one suspected a thing, until a report was released. Turns out that many high-profile organizations like govermental institutions, dimplomatic entities has been spied on for years. Not only your country but Cuba, Morroco, Spain ;) , Tunisia, Brasil totalling 31 countries. After that report many people claimed that Spain as behind the compaign, which, of course, was denied by both the researchers who did the report, and the accused country. 


Now, it's been 10 years since the incident, and life's good.


Yes but why are you considered? 


Because after 10 years of "inactivity", a new report has been released. And now, your day at work is, once again, full of action. 


Buckle up, do your research, you're asked to do a whole report on this cyber espionnage compaign, threat actor, and how the fuck did he came back after 10 years, and what is its new mask. We need to know his stuff, what were their techniques, targets and what tools they used.


The challenge isn't hard, if you look at the right places.


Remember: the name of the challenge is a hint. Don't overcomplicate things.
