SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOUND DEAD IN TUNIS APARTMENT

TUNIS - Police are investigating the suspicious death of a 28-year-old software engineer 
whose body was discovered in her apartment in the La Marsa district of Tunis yesterday.

The victim, identified as Amira El Youssfi, was found by a colleague who became concerned 
when she failed to show up for work at Gorjeni Corp, where she worked as a senior 
software engineer.

According to police sources, the crime scene showed signs of a ritualistic killing. 
A mysterious symbol was carved into the victim's forehead, and the apartment showed 
no signs of forced entry.

"Ms. El Youssfi was a respected member of our cybersecurity team," said Gorjeni Corp 
spokesperson Mohamed Miri. "She was working on several important projects related 
to threat detection and prevention."

The victim's computer and work materials were found at the scene, but investigators 
are still determining if any sensitive information was compromised.

Police are asking anyone with information about Ms. El Youssfi's activities in the days 
leading up to her death to contact the investigation hotline.

The case is being handled by the Tunis Police Department's Major Crimes Unit.
