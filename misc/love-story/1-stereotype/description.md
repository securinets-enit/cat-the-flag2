# 1- Stereotype 

So you're dating a cybersec enthusiast. Apart from yapping about how they found a hard flag or how they're ready to turn their life into an illegal dark web business, THEY CAN'T EXPRESS ANYTHING THAT THEY FEEL. 

Take away assembly, CTFs and expensive certs, they can only express their emotions through encoded/encrypted/hidden messages. 

Recently, they sent you this picture but it seems broken.

Can you find out what the f are they trynna say?
