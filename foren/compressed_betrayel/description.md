# Compressed Betrayel


Summer is over and you're back to school. Preparing the required files, paying the fees and listening to brain-dead students trying to convince you to join their major, you did it all.


Now, the school's website is asking for a picture of yourself to upload to the website. But there is a size limitation. So you navigated the web trying to find a compression tool, which was succesful, and you're now officially back to school. 

And from that moment, your laptop doesn't feel the same, there are some unnecessary peaks in the cpu and network usage, sometimes files show up and quickly get deleted. I mean there is something wrong right?

Now it's your job to find what's wrong. It can't be that bad right?

Here is your history file. Good luck!
