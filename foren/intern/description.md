# Intern

You've always ran into memes about interns fucking up the whole infrastrucuture. But you've always laughed, reacted to the post and moved on with your life. 

Until today. 

You woke up to calls, text messages and urgent tickets.

It's official, all of your clients' data is leaked. PII, passwords and lots of other security details is now for sale.

Investigate the log files and find out what the fuck happened.

**Note from the author:** I suggest you get the whole concept of the attack chain and what/how exactly did the attacker get inside your network and what got exfiltrated. Providing a writeup for this incident will prove fruitful.
