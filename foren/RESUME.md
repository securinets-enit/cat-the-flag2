# README 

### In short

I mainly authored this category along with `Cassproxia`. The players liked the challenges as we tried to craft reallistic and real-life scenarios.

No challenges remained unsolved (gladly), but people struggled in `Poor Hacker - A Push Further`. 

No strange tickets were opened, the attack paths and vectors were clear and people learned something new, which we consider as a success. 

No challenge was hard 'just to be hard'. Nothing was put in a strange a place, or a strange technique to do to find a flag or whatever, so that's a + for us. 

Everything was clear for the user, it only needed a good inspection.

Really good feedback was given after the CTF even from experienced people. 

### My tasks

I Authored the following tasks: 
- Poor Hacker: Analysis of a linux disk image of a caught hacker. (easy)
- poor Hacker - A Push Further: Gathering more intel on the hacker tooling. People seamed to struggle in this as it remained unsolved until we gave hints in tickets. Only one player managed to hit the spot and get the idea behind the challenge, but all the others required some help. (hard when you use ChatGPT)
- Khlos L Supplier: Analysis of eml files to find a malicious one. (players didn't find a problem at solving this, but hopefully they solved it methodically)
- First Time: Pcap file analysis, easy but could've been much more layered and complicated. It's question of time: who solves it first. 
- Intern: Analysis of long `xferlog` and `auth.log` files. Let's say hard because it had 29 questions to answer, it required the playres to connect the dots between the parts of the incident that happened. 
- Compressed Betrayal: Analysis of a History file to find a  malicious legit-looking software. Let's say medium because the analysis of the software was guided via an asker and the History file wasn't really large. This is a pretty layered challenge that tired me the most in building its infrastructure. 

### Closing thoughts

The new players and new comers to the field showed really great potential. New members showed really great perseverence, persitence and willingness to contribute and learn something new. Surprisingly, many of them neglected LLMs and tried everything on their own, which was something unexpected from someone really new. 

Worth the efforts.
